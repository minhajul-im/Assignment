# Assignment

1. *.next*: This folder is generated when we build the project. It contains the compiled output, server code, and other build-related files.
2. *node_modules*: This folder contains all the project's dependencies, installed using npm.
3. *public*: Static assets like images, fonts, etc., go here. They are publicly accessible and can be linked in our components.
4. *src*: This is where most of our code will reside.
    
  *app*: The app folder in a Next.js project is used to contain the application code, including pages, components, and utils. If you use the src directory, this folder will be ignored.
  
  The app folder is a good place to put code that is shared across multiple pages or components, such as a layout component or a utility function. It can also be used to put code that is specific to the application, such as a custom router or a database connection.
    
  *components*: This folder holds our React components. These can be reused across different pages.
  - *styles*: CSS files or styling-related assets are kept here.
  - *utils*: Utility functions or helper files can be placed here.
  
1. *package.json*: This file contains project metadata and lists dependencies. It also includes scripts that we can use for various tasks.
2. *package-lock.json*: This file is generated by npm and keeps track of the exact version of each installed package.
3. *[README.md](http://readme.md/)*: This is where we can provide documentation or information about our project.
4. *.gitignore*: This file specifies which files and folders should not be tracked by version control (Git).
5. *next.config.js*: This file allows us to customize Next.jsÂ configuration.
